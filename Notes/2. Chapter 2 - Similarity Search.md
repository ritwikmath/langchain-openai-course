Similarity search is the technique of identifying the items in a dataset that are more similar to a provided query. 
Similarity search uses **Vector Embeddings** to recognize the similar items. 

# FAISS

FAISS or **Facebook AI Similarity Search** is a library that allows search for embeddings of multimedia documents like text, image, video and more that are similar to each other. FAISS is capable of searching in sets of vectors of any size. Even if the vector does not fit in RAM, FAISS can search in that vector.

**Create a  Vector Store from Text:**

```python
from dotenv import load_dotenv  
from langchain_community.vectorstores import FAISS  
from langchain_openai import OpenAIEmbeddings

load_dotenv()
  
vector_store = FAISS.from_texts(["Ritwik works at Global Logic"], embedding=OpenAIEmbeddings())  
print(vector_store)

```
